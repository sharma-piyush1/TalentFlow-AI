**Subject:** Machine Learning Opportunity | Your expertise in RAG & FastAPI

Hi Firoz,

I’ve been following your work on GitHub (firoz1905) and was particularly impressed by your deep experience with RAG pipelines and vector embeddings like FAISS. Your background in building containerized microservices using Python, FastAPI, and Docker is a perfect match for the Machine Learning Engineer role we are looking to fill.

We are currently scaling a Generative AI platform that relies heavily on LangChain and efficient model deployment. Given your proficiency with Redis and Celery, I believe you would bring the exact type of engineering maturity our team needs to optimize our current infrastructure.

Are you open to a brief 15-minute introductory call this Thursday or Friday to discuss the impact you could make here?

Best regards,

**Subject:** Exploring GenAI & Cloud-Native ML Roles at [Company Name]

Hi Swastik,

I came across your profile while researching experts in the "Modern ML Stack." Your focus on Generative AI, coupled with your hands-on experience in Docker and Kubernetes, caught my attention immediately. 

We are looking for an engineer who can bridge the gap between AI research and production-grade deployment. Your work with LangChain and cloud-native infrastructure aligns perfectly with our roadmap for building scalable LLM applications. I’d love to learn more about your recent projects and share what we’re building in the GenAI space.

Would you be available for a quick chat early next week? You can pick a time that works for you here: [Link to Calendar].

Cheers,

**Subject:** Graph Analytics + LLMs | Connecting with a Neo4j Ninja

Hi Bhavesh,

As a Google Developer Expert in ML and a recognized Neo4j Ninja, your reputation in the data science community precedes you. I’ve been reviewing your work in Graph Analytics and was struck by the synergy between your expertise and our current focus on Graph-based Generative AI.

While we are building with a stack that includes Python and LangChain, we are specifically looking for a subject matter expert who understands the underlying logic of Graph Analytics to lead our R&D efforts in LLM integration. Your unique blend of Python mastery and deep knowledge of Neo4j makes you the ideal person for this strategic role.

I’d love to hop on a call to discuss how your vision for AI research aligns with our current projects. Do you have any availability for a brief conversation later this week?

Kind regards,
